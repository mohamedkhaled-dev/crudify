# Crudify – Store Management App

Crudify is a simple store management app that allows users to manage products with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, built entirely with front-end technologies. Using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**.

## ✨ What’s Inside?
- 📦 **CRUD Operations**: Add, view, update, and delete products in a simple, intuitive interface.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Crudify adapts to any screen size, offering a seamless experience.
- ⚡ **Built with JavaScript**: JavaScript powers the app’s functionality, using local storage to save data and make it work without a backend.

## 💡 **Why I Built It**
Crudify was built to improve my JavaScript skills by creating a fully functional app that manages and stores data on the client side. I focused on implementing the full CRUD cycle and working with real-time data, simple validations, and local storage no backend needed.
